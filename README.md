CNN Cancer Detection - Submission to Histopathologic Cancer Detection Kaggle Competition

The problem: In this competition, we are tasked to create an algorithm that will identify metastatic cancer from small images patches with as high accuracy as possible.

The data: We are provided with a large number of small pathology images. The test file has 57.5k files named with an image id, and the train_labels folder provides ground truth labeling for the train files.
